.SH NAME
simple_shell \- a simple UNIX command interpreter

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B simple_shell
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that replicates basic functionality of the shell. It can execute commands, handle built-ins, and manage processes.

.SH OPTIONS
The shell does not take any command line options. It operates in either interactive or non-interactive mode.

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE
When run without arguments, the shell displays a prompt and waits for user input. Commands are executed line by line.

.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE
When run with input redirected from a file or pipe, the shell executes commands without displaying a prompt.

.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell with the specified status. If no status is given, exits with status 0.

.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.

.TP
.B setenv VARIABLE VALUE
Set an environment variable.

.TP
.B unsetenv VARIABLE
Unset an environment variable.

.TP
.B cd [DIRECTORY]
Change the current working directory. If no directory is specified, changes to the home directory.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The shell inherits the environment from the parent process and supports the PATH variable for command lookup.

.SH EXIT STATUS
The shell exits with the status of the last executed command, or the status specified to the exit built-in.

.SH EXAMPLES
To run the shell in interactive mode:
.PP
.RS
.nf
$ ./hsh
($) ls -l
($) exit
.fi
.RE

.PP
